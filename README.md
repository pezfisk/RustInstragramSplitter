# Instagram Image Splitter (Rust)

A simple Rust program that splits an image into 4 quadrants, making it suitable for posting on Instagram (which has a 1080px image size limit). This way, you can avoid losing image detail when posting large images by splitting them into smaller, square pieces.

## Features

- **Splits an image into 4 quadrants**.
- Each quadrant is designed for Instagramâ€™s square post format.
- **Saves each quadrant as a separate file**.
- **Cross-platform**: Can be compiled on various operating systems.

## Dependencies

To build the project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**: The programming language used.
- **[Image](https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/)**: Used for image manipulation (loading, cropping, saving).
- **[Rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/)**: A library for parallel iteration to speed up processing.
- **[RFD](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/)**: A library for file dialogs, which allows the user to select input images easily.
- **[Slint](https://slint.dev/)**: A UI framework to create a simple interface for interacting with the program.
